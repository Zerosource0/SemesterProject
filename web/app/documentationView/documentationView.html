        <h2>How to Login</h2>
        <p>To login as a User you can use these credentials</p>
        <br>
        <p>Username: user</p>

        <p>Password: test</p>
        <br>
        <p>To login as a Admin you can use these credentials</p>
        <br>
        <p>Username: admin</p>

        <p>Password: test</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <br>

        <p>Our test cases were created to both comply with expected values and not. 
            The way we set it up was making two different test classes, one for the rest API
            and one for our facades used in the rest API. In the rest API test we are testing how to login
            and extract user specific information. We also tried extracting information when not logged in as any role
            and expecting to receive a certain status code. For our API we simply tested if the return status 200. We
            did not check any responses made from the API methods. We tried to use a dedicated persistence unit and database for
            the testing but we faced issues when doing so. Not only in the tests but it also seemed to cause problems in our application
            itself. Thus we decided to use the database that the application was using. Yes, it does make our tests less
            valid but we had to compromise for the sake of functionality. </p>

        <p>In the backend testing unlike the API testing we tested more the values that were returned.
            In the backend testing we have tested whether returns are not empty, making it clear that the method works and returns 
            values and not an error. We mainly tested the adding and deleting of new users as we faced issues in our program
            when we initially implemented this feature. We then also test the retrieval of currencies which is used in our 
            exchange rate feature. All in all our test cases seem to pass and our system works as wanted, which was the most
            important thing for us. </p>

        <h2>Postman Testing</h2>
        <h4>URIs</h4>
        Our base URI is 'semesterSeedSP/api/'.
        In order to run the tests you first have to run the web application itself. This will populate tables in your dedicated
        database and make the tests function. In order to test in postman you will have to add to the base URI. Here is a couple of URIs
        <br>
        <p>Get - Users</p>
        <p>/demoadmin/users</p>
        <br>
        <p>Post - Login</p>
        <p>/login, you will also have to pass a json object in the body e.g: {\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"test\"}</p>
        <br>
        <p>Get - Exchange Rates</p>
        <p>/currency/dailyrates</p>
        <br>
        <p>Post - New User</p>
        <p>/newuser, body: {\"username\":\"newUser\",\"password\":\"test\",\"role\":\"admin\"} </p>
        <br>
        <p>Delete - Delete User</p>
        <p>/admin/users/{id}</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: In order to test features that require a login you will have to pass a header in the postman app with the token you receive
            when logging in.</p>
